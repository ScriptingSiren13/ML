## Feature Transformation
Feature transformation is the process of modifying existing features to make them more suitable for machine learning models. The goal is to improve model performance by ensuring the data is clean, consistent, and appropriately scaled.

Common feature transformation techniques include:

### 1. Missing Value Imputation
Missing value imputation involves filling in missing values present in the dataset. Missing data can negatively impact model performance, so handling it properly ensures the model can learn effectively from the available data.

### 2. Handling Categorical Features
Machine learning models work with numerical data rather than categorical data. Handling categorical features involves converting categorical variables into numerical representations so that models can process them.

### 3. Outlier Detection and Handling
Outliers are extreme values that can distort the learning process of a model. Outlier detection involves identifying these extreme values and handling them appropriately to prevent them from negatively affecting model performance.

### 4. Feature Scaling
Feature scaling ensures that all features are on a similar scale. This is important because many machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the magnitude of feature values. Standardization and normalization are commonly used scaling techniques.
